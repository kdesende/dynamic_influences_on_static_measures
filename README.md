# dynamic_influences_on_static_measures
This repo contains the accompanying R  code for the paper "Dynamic influences on static measures of metacognition" authored by Kobe Desender, Luc Vermeylen, and Tom Verguts.

1. DDM Simulations demontrating how meta-d'/d' (=mratio) depends on decision boundary
2. Parameter recovery study on the evidence accumulation model with post-decision accumulation
3. Fitting an evidence accumulation model with post-decision accumulation to Experiment (explicit SATO instructions) to estimate m-ratio and v-ratio
4. Fitting the same model to the data of Drescher et al.
5. Fitting the same model to the data of Prieto et al.
